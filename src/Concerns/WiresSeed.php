 * alphabetically, so a chain resting on `use` position would be resequenced by a formatter.

     * and every beam-* package's seeder fires, each config-gated.
     *
     * The gate is the config key `beam.accounts.demo.seed_users`. It defaults to `env('ACCOUNT_SEED_DEMO_USERS')`
     * (null), and here — mirroring {@see BeamDemo::enabled()} — a null resolves to on-everywhere-but-production, so
     * a production `beam:seed` never fabricates demo subjects while dev/preview seed them by default. Explicit
     * config wins; the resolved boolean is written back onto the same key so the manifest's raw `config($gate)`
     * check reads the effective value.
     *
     * Inert (silently skipped) unless beam-core's {@see BeamSeedManifest} is present — a beam-accounts host
     * composed without the seed command pays nothing.
