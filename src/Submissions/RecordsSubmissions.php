/**
 * The generic capture store for a public-facing form (waitlist signup, contact/interest form,
 * anonymous intake) — a form key + a schema-shaped payload becomes exactly one
 * {@see BeamSubmission} (a beam BeamParticle), persisted through beam-core's single write
 * pipeline ({@see ParticleWriter}) and announced on {@see BeamParticlePersisted} — the one signal
 * every beam write path emits. A host that also composes `splicewire/laravel-beam-notifications`
 * gets a free notification for any form whose schema declares `x-beam-notify` (its
 * `NotifyOnSubmission` listener reacts to this same event, reading the schema this class stamps
 * into `meta.schema` below); this class carries no dependency on that package itself.
 *
 * Lives here (beam-accounts, beside the write gates it depends on), not beam-notifications or a
 * satellite-tier package: nothing about it is satellite-specific — a submission is a base-beam
 * concept. Any beam host (headless, satellite, or tower) that also requires beam-accounts can use
 * it directly.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT resolve the form's schema itself — the caller (typically a controller
 * that already validated the payload against its own copy of the schema for human-facing 422
 * errors) passes the resolved schema document straight through for notify-stamping. This keeps
 * the class free of any opinion about WHERE a host's form schemas live (a JSON file, a DB table,
 * a registry) — that is entirely the caller's concern.
 *
 * The write rides {@see PermissiveWriteGate} (authorization) and {@see PermissiveAcceptanceGate}
 * (schema conformance): this is a server-trusted CAPTURE flow whose caller has already authorized
 * and validated as it sees fit, and a submission is capture — partial/not-yet-conforming payloads
 * must land, not be rejected at write. beam's deny-by-default + validate-on-write defaults are
 * untouched for every other write path; this flow opts out explicitly here.
