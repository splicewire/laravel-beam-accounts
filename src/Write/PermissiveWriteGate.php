/**
 * The SERVER-TRUSTED-caller binding of beam's {@see WriteGate} — an explicit, always-authorizing
 * opt-in for write flows that have ALREADY authorized upstream.
 *
 * Beam's default binding ({@see GateWriteGate}) is deny-by-default: it
 * delegates to the Laravel authorization gate, so a record type with no matching policy is refused.
 * That default is unchanged and remains the safety seam for authenticated CRUD.
 *
 * This binding is NOT bound globally. It is constructed explicitly by a server flow whose caller has
 * already performed authorization — a form controller's own request validation, a guest-token check,
 * or any other server-side capture flow — before the payload reaches the write pipeline. In those
 * flows the gate has nothing left to decide, so it authorizes. The deny-by-default default is never
 * weakened; server flows opt into permissiveness deliberately, at the call site.
